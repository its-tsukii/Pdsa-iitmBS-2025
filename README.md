# Pdsa-iitmBS-2025 📚🐍

A humble repo by **its-tsukii** (LinkedIn: /aayushkukade  ·  Medium: /@sroy10012001)  
A place to keep track of what I’ve done (and what still haunts me) in the PDSA journey.  
Yes — some commits are *absurd*, but hey, that’s part of the fun 😅

## 🎯 What’s this repo about?

This repository tracks my coursework and practice for the BS-Program course **PDSA (Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms using Python)** from IITM. It collects:

- Weekly assignments (GA, PA), group assignments (GRPA), and practice problems.  
- Coding session solutions & notes.  
- Open-week summaries (for recap and revision).  
- “PPA” — personal practice assignments (aka ‘because I felt like it’).  

Essentially: a one-stop “did / to-do / redo” list for anyone who lives, breathes, or procrastinates with algorithms.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Want to clone and browse?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/its-tsukii/Pdsa-iitmBS-2025.git
cd Pdsa-iitmBS-2025
# Explore folders, open notebooks or .py files as you like
````

Prefer viewing on GitHub (without cloning)? That works too — all code and notes are already online.

## 💡 How to Use This (or “Why should you even care?”)

* As a revision companion — review old assignments / solutions when exams or doubts hit.
* For reference — see how a problem was approached / solved before (best when you try yourself first!).
* For inspiration — interested in Python data-structures & algorithms? Browse through. Maybe pick a challenge, code it yourself, then compare.
* (Optional) Contribute — find a bug, improve a solution, or add alternate implementations. Pull-requests always welcome.

---

## 🙏 Contributing & Ground Rules

* Try solving before peeking at the solution.
* If you find mistakes / want to suggest improvements (cleaner code, better variable names, new implementations), feel free to open an issue or PR.
* Keep the basic folder-structure / naming style if you add new content (helps keep this chaos — organised 😂).

## 📜 License & Disclaimer

All code here is my personal work (or collaborative work in GRPA). This repo is **NOT** officially affiliated with IITM.
Use the material for learning, practice, inspiration — but don’t treat it as “official solutions”.
Do your own work first, then if you peek here — use responsibly.

## 😎 Why “Absurd Commits”?

Because nothing says “learning in progress” better than commits titled:

* `fixed bug`
* `idk what I’m doing`
* `try number 5 — maybe this works?`

If you find yourself cringing — you’re in the right place 😄
